            <p> The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a technology that encrypts the transmission of data over the Internet
                to prevent it from being intercepted and decoded. This is particularly important when sensitive information
                such as credit card numbers or passwords are entered on your website, as is often the case for e-commerce
                sites or password protected sections.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sites secured by an SSL certificate display a security lock in the web browser and may display a security
                seal. If you sell items online, if you have password protected sections on your website, or if you host
                online forms requesting personal information, you are strongly encouraged to obtain an SSL certificate.
                Not only will your account security be improved, but you will increase the confidence of your visitors,
                which often results in higher conversion rates and higher sales.

                EssentialSSL is an affordable certificate, which offers 256-bit encryption for a single domain
                (for example www.yourdomain.com). It is the most popular certificate and is recommended for sites that
                generate up to C $ 50,000 in revenue annually.
            </p>
            <p>
                The WildCard SSL provides the same 256-bit encryption on an unlimited number of subdomains.
                It is a good solution for multilingual sites, multi-currency shops, or any other account using multiple sub-domains.
            </p>
            <p>
                The SSL Extended Validation (EV) certificate is the most advanced and the only certificate to offer
                green bar technology, which changes the color of your web browser's address bar on secure pages,
                giving your visitors an additional level of insurance. The EV certificate also includes a dynamic seal,
                which displays the name and address of your company, as well as the period of validity of the certificate.
                If customer trust is crucial to your site, EV certificates are recommended.

                If your account is already hosted at Techno24.net, our technicians will install your certificate on your
                account for free. Please note that all SSL certificates require a dedicated IP address (which can be ordered
                at the same time as your certificate for a small annual fee). Depending on the certificate you choose, you may
                be asked to provide proof of your identity or the identity of your business. These requests will be sent to
                you by e-mail after your order.

                To use your SSL certificate, simply change your links (or URL) from "http" to "https". All https pages
                are encrypted with your SSL certificate. If you use a content management system (such as WordPress, or
                any e-commerce software), you will need to configure your software to use the installed SSL certificate.
