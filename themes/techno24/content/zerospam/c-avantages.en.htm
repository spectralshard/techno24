    Precise analysis mechanisms and reliable filters
</h3>
<p>
    The majority of spam emails are rejected at the blocking stage. The remaining emails move on to active analysis,
    where the email stream is cleaned by a variety of filter rules. The quarantine allows the user to check individual
    emails for which the classification is unclear.

    Phishing filter
</h3>
<p>
    Link tracking and other mechanisms effectively protect against phishing emails. Among other things,
    reloadable malicious script commands are detected. This enables, for example, the detection of dangerous drive-by
    downloads.
</p>
<h3 class="text-primary h3-responsive">
    Infomail filter
</h3>
<p>
    Newsletters not classified as spam and other info emails that interrupt the workflow unnecessarily are filtered out
    and stored for later retrieval. They are listed in the individual quarantine report and can be delivered and allow
    listed by mouse click if required.

<h3 class="text-primary h3-responsive">
    Link tracking
</h3>
<p>
    Incoming and outgoing emails are automatically scanned for malicious URLs.
</p>
<h3 class="text-primary h3-responsive">
    Automatic virus signature update
</h3>
<p>
    The malware filters are constantly updated and are always up to date. Among other things, the company uses its own
    scanners, which are specialized in malware spread by emails.
</p>
<h3 class="text-primary h3-responsive">
    Outbound filtering
</h3>
<p>
    Outgoing emails are checked for spam and viruses to prevent the customer from unintentionally sending or
    forwarding malware and spam emails.
</p>
<h3 class="text-primary h3-responsive">
    Bounce management
</h3>
<p>
    Only genuine bounces reach the recipient in incoming mail traffic; bounces in response to spam with fake sender
    addresses are reliably filtered out.
</p>
<h3 class="text-primary h3-responsive">
    Content filter for file attachments
</h3>
<p>
    Unwanted attachments can be rejected or moved to quarantine.

    Dynamic virus outbreak detection
</h3>
<p>
    New and previously unknown viruses are stopped by the early warning system. Hornetsecurity permanently analyzes
    incoming emails on so-called honeypot accounts (email addresses whose sole purpose is to receive spam) for unusual
    attachments, links, senders or contents. The derivation of signatures from this is carried out within the shortest
    possible reaction time (usually <5 minutes).
